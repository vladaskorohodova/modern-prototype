# Accessibility

Building accessible applications is a core principle of the Modern React Library. Every component is designed with accessibility in mind, following WCAG 2.1 guidelines.

## Our approach

We believe accessibility should be built-in, not bolted on. All our components include:

- **Semantic HTML**: We use the right HTML elements for the right purposes
- **ARIA attributes**: Proper ARIA labels, roles, and states where needed
- **Keyboard navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interactive elements
- **Screen reader support**: Tested with popular screen readers like NVDA and JAWS
- **Focus management**: Clear focus indicators and logical tab order

## Key principles

### 1. Perceivable

All information and UI components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

- Provide text alternatives for non-text content
- Ensure sufficient color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
- Make sure content is responsive and works at different zoom levels

### 2. Operable

User interface components and navigation must be operable.

- All functionality is available from keyboard
- Users have enough time to read and use content
- Content doesn't cause seizures or physical reactions
- Users can easily navigate and find content

### 3. Understandable

Information and operation of the user interface must be understandable.

- Text is readable and understandable
- Content appears and operates in predictable ways
- Users are helped to avoid and correct mistakes

### 4. Robust

Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Component accessibility

Each component in our system includes detailed accessibility documentation:

- Keyboard shortcuts and navigation patterns
- ARIA attributes used
- Screen reader announcements
- Focus management behavior

Check the individual component documentation for specific accessibility features.

## Testing

We recommend testing your applications with:

- **axe DevTools**: Browser extension for automated accessibility testing
- **NVDA** or **JAWS**: Popular screen readers for testing
- **Keyboard only**: Try navigating your app without a mouse
- **Color contrast checkers**: Ensure your color choices meet WCAG standards
